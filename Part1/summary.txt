For the EDA, I kicked things off by loading the sales.csv, features.csv, and stores.csv datasets, peeking at the first 10 rows to get a feel for the data. I ran stats like means and standard deviations to spot trends, then threw in histograms, boxplots, and bar charts to visualize stuff like Weekly_Sales and Type. A correlation heatmap helped me see how variables play together, especially with Weekly_Sales.

For preprocessing, I tackled missing values by filling MarkDown1-MarkDown5 with zeros (no promos, probably) and CPI and Unemployment with medians to keep things smooth. Outliers in Weekly_Sales got trimmed using IQR to avoid skewing the model. I turned Date into Year, Month, and Week, made IsHoliday a 0/1 flag, and one-hot encoded Type into Type_A, Type_B, Type_C. Numerical columns got standardized with StandardScaler for fairness, and I used SMOTE to balance the rare holiday weeks in IsHoliday. Finally, I picked the top 10 features with SelectKBest, keeping heavy hitters like Dept and Size while ditching redundant ones like Type encodings.

What stood out? Sales spike hard in November/December—think Thanksgiving and Christmas—and tank in January/February. Bigger stores (Type A) rake in more cash, while Type C lags. Holidays boost sales a bit, especially during big weeks like Black Friday. MarkDown promos don’t always pack a punch unless paired with holidays. I also noticed Type and Size were super correlated, so I dropped Type to avoid overlap. The IsHoliday imbalance was a sneaky issue, fixed with SMOTE to give holidays a fair shot. All these steps cleaned the data up nice and tight, ready for modeling!
